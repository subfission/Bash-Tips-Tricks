## üìÅ Quick Reference

* **POSIX Built-ins:** guaranteed in all compliant shells.
* **Bash-specific Built-ins:** available only in Bash.
* **Exportable Variables:** propagate to subshells and external programs once exported.
* **Bash-maintained Variables:** reflect shell internals; not inherited by child processes.

For details on your system:

```bash
help               # lists all built-ins
help <builtin>     # shows help for a specific builtin
man bash           # authoritative reference for builtins & special variables
